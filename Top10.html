      <li>Baldur's Gate</li>
      <p>
        It's hard to pinpoint exactly what makes
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baldur's_Gate_3" target="_blank"
          >Baldur's Gate </a
        >so special, but to some extent that is what makes it so special. In its
        attempt to replicate the infinite imagination of Dungeons & Dragons,
        developer Larian Studios has pushed the concept of player freedom as far
        as possible, crafting a rewarding experience even for those who push the
        critical path to its limits. But technical excellence can only take you
        so far, and a world you can manipulate means little if there's no
        incentive to do so. Thankfully, Baldur's Gate 3 excels there too, with a
        world that begs you to explore, and characters that take you on their
        sprawling adventures, which in turn twist and adapt as you test the
        edges of your own story. There's nothing quite like it.

      <li>Alan Wake 2</li>
      <p>
        A spiral into darkness from Remedy Entertainment, the developer
        leveraging its most imaginative and idiosyncratic impulses to deliver a
        horror story unlike any other, a nightmare violently assaulting two
        interweaving realities. It's taken Remedy over a decade to write this
        sequel into our reality and the resulting experience works hard to
        constantly defy expectations at every turn. The introduction of a second
        hero protagonist in Saga Anderson was an inspired creative choice, her
        crawl through the wilds of Bright Falls offering countless opportunities
        for the heavy, horrifying combat and abstract personalities which occupy
        the world to shine. While the decision to blend Alan Wake's descent
        through the Dark Place with live-action film and spectacularly-rendered
        cinematics only propels this adventure to new heights
        <a href="https://www.alanwake.com" target="_blank">Alan Wake 2</a> is a
        triumph.
      </p>
      <li>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</li>
      <p>
        Nintendo broke from Zelda tradition in 2017, transforming the series
        into a freeform open world that's so impactful the entire industry is
        still catching up. "It's like Breath of the Wild" became shorthand for
        compelling open-world design, and it's appropriate that it took a
        half-decade, and the full might of Nintendo's first-party development
        resources, to finally improve on the modern classic.
        <a
          href="https://www.gamesradar.com/legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-review/"
          target="_blank"
          >The Legend of Zelda:Tears of the Kingdom</a
        >
        is "like Breath of the Wild," yes, but it's better. That's because of
        Ultrahand; Tears of the Kingdom's building mechanic is as intuitive as
        building with Lego and twice as efficient, allowing you to quickly
        construct everything from simple bridges to flying saucers that rain
        down terror on enemies from above. Where once you had to merely survive
        in that land, Tears of the Kingdom gives you the tools you need to
        conquer it.
      </p>
      <li>Marvel's Spider Man 2</li>
      <p>
        Despite the fact that expectations were perhaps never higher, developer
        Insomniac Games absolutely delivered this year with
        <a
          href="https://www.marvel.com/games/marvels-spider-man-2"
          target="_blank"
          >Marvel's Spider Man 2</a
        >. Proving that there's still plenty to explore and address in the world
        of Spider-Man, even after the original and Miles Morales, is no mean
        feat, especially with the wonder of swinging through Manhattan at top
        speed already being familiar territory. And yet somehow, Spider-Man 2
        manages to weave the personal, professional, and superhero lives of
        Miles and Peter together in a way that both feels nostalgic to classic
        comic fans and a synthesis all its own. Kraven and Venom are by no means
        new characters, but the game makes them feel fresh and even menacing.
        The fine folks at Insomniac took the responsibility of Spider-Man as a
        franchise seriously, and a powerful sequel is the result.

      <li>Cocoon</li>
      <p>
        Spend an hour with
        <a
          href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1497440/COCOON/"
          target="_blank"
          >Cocoon</a
        >
        and you'll feel like the smartest player to ever pick up a gamepad. Run
        it through, and you won't quite understand how you managed to reach the
        credits. Geometric Interactive does such a good job of quietly teaching
        you esoteric solutions to exceptionally conceptual puzzles that you
        won't grasp at the absurdity, or enormity, of the actions you are
        instinctually undertaking until you've successfully completed them.
        Cocoon is an astoundingly smart, ingeniously creative adventure where
        you are tasked with weaving different worldstates together to progress
        across an astoundingly-beautiful biomechanical tapestry. It's one of the
        best puzzle games of the generation and a stunning debut, a team
        leveraging its past experience working on Limbo and Inside to deliver a
        truly unforgettable, dreamlike adventure.

      <li>Resident Evil 4 Remake</li>
      <p>
        There's no such thing as a perfect video game, but Resident Evil 4 came
        damn close in 2005. So much so that generations of players have believed
        that this survival horror was untouchable, even after Capcom rendered
        such impressive returns to the Spencer Mansion and Raccoon City into
        reality. Perhaps that's why the
        <a href="https://www.residentevil.com/re4/en-asia/" target="_blank"
          >Resident evil 4 remake
        </a>
        Remake is such an achievement. An audacious prospect met with ambitious
        execution; a reimagining of one of the best games of all-time that is
        able to sand down some rough edges without losing sight of the utterly
        outrageous scenario and narrative design which defined the original.
        It's silly and scary, campy and corrosive, a brilliantly-weighted action
        experience that never fails to surprise and delight. With Resident Evil
        4, Capcom has unequivocally cemented its reputation as the master of the
        modern remake.
      </p>
      <li>Super Mario Bros. Wonder</li>
      <p>
        We didn't think a side-scrolling Mario platformer would emerge as one of
        the most innovative and refreshing games of the year, and yet here we
        are.
        <a href="https://supermariobroswonder.nintendo.com/" target="_blank"
          >Super Mario Bros. Wonder
        </a>
        is filled with surprises, fuelled by the titular Wonder Flowers which,
        once discovered in a level, will completely change what you're doing.
        Whether that's turning levels into a top-down maze, transforming Mario
        and friends into Goombas, or turning everything into a musical, it's
        impossible to anticipate where Wonder will take you next. It's easily
        one of the best Mario games ever made, with a refreshing attitude to
        multiplayer that gives options for both online and local play. Wonder is
        a delight to play, with plenty of creativity and humor squeezed into
        every animation, not to mention some of the most inventive and
        wide-reaching new power-ups to feature in a 2D Mario.
      </p>
      <li>Star Wars Jedi: Survivor</li>
      <p>
        <a
          href="https://www.starwars.com/games-apps/star-wars-jedi-survivor"
          target="_blank"
        >
          Star Wars Jedi: Survivor
        </a>
        succeeds where so many sequels stumble. The last time Cal Kestis was
        placed within our control, the Padawan of a fallen order rose to Jedi
        Knight status, surviving an encounter with one of the most powerful Sith
        Lords in the galaxy. It would have been all too easy for developer
        Respawn Entertainment to have disentangled Cal's connection to the
        Force, leaving him vulnerable enough to spend half of a new adventure
        relearning his way around a lightsaber. Instead, Jedi: Survivor simply
        ups the ante from the outset. Forcing you to travel more challenging
        terrains and contend with a higher density of enemies, pressuring you to
        deftly wield a powerful, ever-improving skill set with deadly efficiency
        and impressive acrobacy. The resulting experience is one of the finest
        Star Wars adventures of the modern era.
      </p>
      <li>Diablo 4</li>
      <p>
        Whether you're exploring its depths alone or fighting against the forces
        of darkness with friends,<a
          href="https://diablo4.blizzard.com/en-us/"
          target="_blank"
        >
          Diablo 4 </a
        >is a hell of a time. A diabolical assault on the senses where simple,
        repetitive actions are rewarded with an endless stream of powerful
        items, the growth of your character measured in the smallest of
        percentages. It's a compulsive and familiar loop, one which works
        all-too-well within the expressive, persistent open world that developer
        Blizzard Entertainment crafted and has continued to evolve. Strong
        foundations were set at launch and have been smartly expanded upon in
        the months since, leading to this sense that Diablo 4 is always angling
        for some new way to draw out an intoxicating, impulsive drive for
        experimentation in all who dare to join the battle for Sanctuary's soul.
        If you aren't careful, Diablo 4 has the power to decimate your free
        time.

      <li>Dredge</li>
      <p>
        A fishing horror game is not something we expected 2023 to deliver, let
        alone one which is utterly essential.
        <a href="https://www.dredge.game/" target="_blank"> Dredge</a>is able to
        succeed in part because of a simple, incredibly compelling gameplay
        loop, with developer Black Salt Games thrusting a constant sense of
        reward upon you as you fish, sell, upgrade your ship, and come back "for
        just one more trip." The more time that you sink into this weird world,
        the more capable you become, and confident in sailing across
        increasingly treacherous and twisted open waters. But there's so much
        more to Dredge lurking (quite literally) beneath the surface; an
        Eldritch mystery, one that's as terrifying and inexplicable as the wild
        blue void which always surrounds you. Even if you've never had an
        appetite for Lovecraftian angling before, Dredge will undoubtedly turn
        you into a true believer.
